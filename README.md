## Description
An employee directory created with React.js and populated by the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) that features components, state management, props and search/sort.

## Installation
Fork and clone the repository, then npm install all dependencies.

## Usage
This app would help a manager to quickly access employee data. The user can sort employees by name or search by name, which re-renders the employees on each keystroke. Since this page was created with React using state, the page renders quickly.
